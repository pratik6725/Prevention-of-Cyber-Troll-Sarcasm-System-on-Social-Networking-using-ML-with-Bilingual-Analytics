The virtual social media managing platform will help the user to analyse the comments received on the posts created by the user. The current system used for monitoring social media platforms is manually analysing comments and deleting negative comments or manually blocking a regular spammer or hate promotor. This web application will eliminate the effort required to manually screen thousands of comments and block hundreds of spam users. The user has to register to the application and then provide permission to the web application for accessing his account by authenticating via the OAuth platform. The application then retrieves the comments on the posts.  The suitable algorithms for sentiment analysis and sarcasm are applied on the comments and displays the aggregated results on the panel home. The user can search for specific posts and view analytics for those posts. The platform can also provide auto-replies for positive comments and reports/blocks negative comments.  The application also blocks spam users.  Hence, this application will highly contribute towards reducing online hate and help influencers to manage their social media profiles.
